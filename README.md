> Indrz is a web application for indoor wayfinding, mapping and routing. The platform is for example used by a University that wants to provide its guests, staff and students a web map platform to allow them to find anything on campus.

## Setup your development environment
The running frontend code is of no real use without it's best friend the
[BACKEND API](https://gitlab.com/indrz/indrz-backend). Head over to get it
started. Next up:

1. ``git clone https://gitlab.com/indrz/indrz-frontend.git``
1. ``yarn install``
1. ``yarn run dev``

If you have issues with your install these three little steps usually help
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm yarn.lock
yarn cache clean
yarn install
```

## Create production build
```
yarn run generate
```
Now just copy the `/dist` folder to your favourite webserver or static file server to serve it up using
nginx, S3, GCP cloud storage, Netlify, you name it.
